Each figure is generated using the Jupyter notebook file fign.ipynb. The notebook load data contained in .npz files and plots the resulting figures/subfigures, which are then assembled/customized with Inkscape. The fign_all.pdf is the resulting figure after modification on Inkscape.

The fig2.ipynb files requires a mathematica kernel (see Wolframclient)
