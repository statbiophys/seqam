# seqam (Sequential Affinity Maturation)
Repository associated with the paper "Affinity maturation for an optimal balance between long-term immune coverage and short-term resource constraints" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12124).

Each figure is generated using the Jupyter notebook file fign.ipynb. The notebook load data contained in .npz files and plots the resulting figures/subfigures, which are then assembled/customized with Inkscape.

The fig2.ipynb files requires a mathematica kernel (see Wolframclient)
